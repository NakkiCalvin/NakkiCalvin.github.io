Our brand is very important to us and we want to share with you our shared values, goals and most importantly what our plans are for NRW. Being transparent, consistent and cohesive is extremely important to our vision and we aim to keep this a main factor in the way we conduct our present and future projects. We focus on providing our fans with a curated selection of work to inspire. All work used in curation are from multiple formats that are not our own. We simply put together several pieces of artistic expression to create a mood, feeling, vision made to inspire. The way we choose visuals and text to express our brand directly impacts the overall strength and value of our identity.
Shared Values

Our Shared Values are essential elements that help ground us in our work, mold our interactions with musicians and fans alike, and guide us in the correct direction us as we spearhead our mission forward.

Excellence: We seek continuous improvement. Without it, we will become complacent and not carry out our work as we should do. We have surely made these mistakes in the past and we wish to be better for the musicians, fans and the growth of the scene as a whole. Great communication is essential to building great bonds and most importantly trust.

Service: We are committed to serving the needs of the musicians in the Retrowave scene. As the scene grows, major industries will be looking to work with the scene in their campaigns. NRW aims to be a network to not only connect the musician with a growing base of supportive retro fans and consumers, but to offer them an outlet where they can release their music, feel safe and most importantly give them opportunities to help them in their careers. We strive to exceed the expectations of our fans, clients customers and consumers with every interaction.

Main Mission: To share and spread the Retrowave sound and culture with the world. This is our mission.
